## If you made a decision to start a Start-Up

- It is better to make a product loved by less amount of people than to make a product loved by huge amount of people. WHY? It is because the former is much more easier to get additional users. Think about it. It's easy.

- Building a start-up requires a lot of endurance. But, if you have another secure ability("HARD SKILLS") for a job, it will be a lot more easier to persist. 

## IDEA FIRST

- Idea is important for start-ups. You must be able to answer these two questions. 
  - **WHAT** ARE YOU MAKING?
  - **WHY** ARE YOU MAKING?
- The best case is the founder is a main user of the service. 
- The second best case is the founder is well-understanding the user.
- If there are some users, the **current amount of user** and the **growth rate** are important.
- If people really likes the service, they will automatically recommend to their friends.
- If there are no users, think about what is the first thing to do to get a user.
- **HOW TO TEST IDEAS**
1. Launch the service. -> **B2C idea**
2. Talk with possible users, make what they want. -> **B2B idea**
- **FIRST** find users, **NEXT** develop ideas with feedbacks.
  

## Extra things you must think of
- **WHY** are you starting with __THIS__ company?
- How are you going to **MONOPOLY**(making hard to copy the business)
- Does the market growing?
- Is the market advantageous for the team to conquer?

### Perfect TIMING to join the market
- When the major tech paradigm starts to CHANGE
- AND most of the people does not notice the CHANGE
  - This is when large tech companies can't handle. **OPPORTUNITY for the START-UPS**

## The Idea Should Be...
- Completely NEW(Never heard of)
- People wants to help acheiving hard goals, not easy one.
- Best idea could sound bad...so no need to hide your idea.
- It is better to talk to good people it. They may help you!
- Please do not care about people who hates you. They always exist.

## If you don't have IDEAS
- NO
- Idea FIRST
- Don't try hard to squeeze ideas. 
- Instead, learn about various things. 
- Learn about noticing **PROBLEM**, **INEFFICIENT THINGS** and **MAJOR TECHNOLOGY CHANGE**
- **Participate** on projects that make you exciting.
- Get along with smart people. 
- **THEN someday the idea will appear.**
- **Do not be nervous.**
